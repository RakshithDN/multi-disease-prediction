This folder is meant to store the trained model files used by the Flask app.
Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, model files are not uploaded here.

To run the project locally:
1. Train the models using the notebook (MultiDiseasePrediction.ipynb)
2. Save the trained models into this folder
3. Then run app.py to launch the web app.
